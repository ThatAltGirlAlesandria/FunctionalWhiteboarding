## Description

This weeks assignment at Epicodus is to complete peer reviewed mock technical interviews with whiteboarding.I solved the four prompts with both JavaScript (recommended) and C#. All functions tested and work.

## Prompts
### Question #1: Turning Strings to URLs
URLs cannot have spaces. Instead, all spaces in a string are replaced with %20. Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20.

You may not use the replace() method or regular expressions to solve this problem. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: "Jasmine Ann Jones"
Output: "Jasmine%20Ann%20Jones"

### Question #2: Array Deduping
Write an algorithm that removes duplicates from an array. Do not use a function like filter() to solve this. Once you have solved the problem, demonstrate how it can be solved with filter(). Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi", 7, 53]
Output: [7, 9, "hi", 12, 53]

### Question #3: Compressing Strings
Write an algorithm that takes a string with repeated characters and compresses them, using a number to show how many times the repeated character has been compressed. For instance, aaa would be written as 3a. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: "aaabccdddda"
Output: "3ab2c4da"

### Question #4: Checking for Uniqueness
Write an algorithm that determines whether all the elements in a string are unique. You may not convert the string into an array or use array methods to solve this problem. The algorithm should return a boolean.

Example
Input: "hello"
Output: false
Input: "copyright"
Output: true
